# 1005 Nuclear reactor

## Description
There is a handsome guy who's name is "Nine days five f**ks go upstairs must stretch leg who wants to top up but failed and one shoot purple DaYe". Just for convenience, we call him "DaYe" in short.
DaYe is a naughty guy, who always loves making trouble. He was in charge of a nuclear reactor, Because of careless, he found out something was unusual: 
There is a high-energy particle injection reactors! When high-energy particles crashing nuclear, particle is absorbed, released three high-energy particles and a low-energy particles; And when the low-energy nuclear particles crashing nuclear, the particle is absorbed, released two high-energy particles and a low-energy particles. DaYe defines that the time of the first high-energy particle injection reactors is time 0(microsecond), and each microsecond causes an event occurs. Also, all particles will strike nuclear. To fix this trouble, DaYe wants to know how many particles are there at time n. Can you help him?


## Input
There are multiple test cases. In each test case, the first line contains some characters without blank. The length of the characters in each test case will not larger than 100000. And the second line contains a number n means there are n querys. Then, there will following n lines, each line has a number k asks for the kth character DaYe deleted for fun.

## Output
For each test case, print the character what DaYe asked in a single line.
