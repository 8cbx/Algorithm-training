## Description
There is a handsome guy who's name is "Nine days five problems go upstairs must stretch leg and one shoot purple DaYe". Just for convenience, we call him "DaYe" in short.
DaYe is a brillent guy, who always loves math. One day, he found a special sequence, which looks like "Fibonacci Sequence". He call this sequence "DaYe Sequence",and the number in it is "DaYe number". To form a DaYe sequence, he lets the first number equal to 1 and the second number equal to 2, and from the third number, every number is equal to the sum of the two previous numbers mod 1e9 + 7.
Now, DaYe wants to know the nth DaYe number, can you help him?

## Input

## Output
For each test case, print the nth DaYe number in a single line.
